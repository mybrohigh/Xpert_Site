# Provider ID

Provider ID is a unique identifier that links your subscription to an account on the website [happ-proxy.com](https://happ-proxy.com/). It provides access to advanced application usage statistics and allows accurate tracking of the number of active devices.

***

#### Where to Get Provider ID?

To obtain the Provider ID, you need to register on the website [https://happ-proxy.com](https://happ-proxy.com/)

After registration, you will be able to see it in the upper right part of the screen or in the user profile.

#### **How It Works**

Once a day, the application sends a GET request to:

```
https://check.happ-proxy.com/provider?id={ProviderID}
```

The request includes:

* **providerid** вЂ” your unique identifier;
* **domain hash**, from which the subscription is loaded;
* **HWID** of the device;
* **name and version** of the operating system.

The domain hash ensures that the ProviderID is tied to a specific subscription domain and prevents its use on other sites or in third-party subscriptions.

#### **Ways to Transmit ProviderID**

You can add ProviderID to the subscription in three ways:

1. **In URL** (query parameter)

   ```
   https://your-domain.com/sub/123#?providerid={ProviderID}
   ```
2. **In the Subscription Body** (comment)

   ```
   #providerid {ProviderID}
   vless://70cc48c5вЂ‘b2f4вЂ¦
   vmess://zkIAU1JitkIвЂ¦
   ```
3. **In the HTTP Header** of the Response

   ```
   HTTP/2 200 OK
   date: Wed, 14 Apr 2025 10:00:00 GMT
   content-type: application/json
   content-length: 3798
