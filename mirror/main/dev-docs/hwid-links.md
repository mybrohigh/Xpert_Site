HWID links are subscriptions tied to a specific device. Verification is performed locally on the client side.

To create such a link, first obtain the device's HWID, then generate the link in your personal account.

HWID link creation is only available through happ-proxy.com.

#### Creating via the website

1. On the Link Limit page, select the HWID Links section.
2. Specify the unencrypted URL of your subscription.
3. Enter the HWID of the device for which the link is intended.

**After generation:**

* The HWID parameter is automatically added to the URL.
* You will receive an encrypted link.

***

#### **How it works**

When adding the link, the application compares the HWID in the link with the device's HWID. If they match, the link is added to the application.
